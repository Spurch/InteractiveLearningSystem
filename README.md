## Project Overview
  The Interactive Learning System (ILS for short) is an idea I have been considering for some time. On its current stage/level my idea is to implement a simple/basic system for creating and managing Schools, Groups and User accounts with different roles, views, functions etc. Some basic functionality for messaging, CRUD for Tasks, Problems, Answers etc. 
  For the future the ILS will support a logging system and a functionality to store history records for the students/teachers activity.

## Details

## Summary
  - Project requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/TelerikAcademy/ASP.NET-MVC/tree/master/Final%20Project/2016)
  - The ILS uses/requires some additional assets like:
    - Kendo UI for ASP .NET MVC.
    - Images and other graphics.
    - Others.
    - Those assets have pending licence agreements hence are property of their respective owners and are not included in this repo.
    - NOTE: The project won't behave as expected without those assets.
